# Coworking Frontend

Welcome to the frontend of the Coworking project! This project was created for a Hackathon with the goal of helping people who have spaces available for coworking to advertise and manage their spaces.

## Purpose

The purpose of the Coworking project is to provide a platform for our customer who has extra space in their office, to rent out as coworking space. This can be a great way for these individuals to earn extra income while also providing a convenient and affordable workspace for others.

## Future

- **Space listings:** Users can browse and search for available coworking spaces in their area. Each listing includes details about the space, such as its size, location, and amenities.
- **Space scheduling:** Interested users can schedule a tour or meeting to see a coworking space in person. The space owner can then confirm or decline the request.
- **Messaging:** Users can communicate with each other through the platform to ask questions, negotiate terms, or make arrangements for renting the space.

## Running the project

To run the Coworking project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `frontend` directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` to start the development server.

You should now be able to access the Coworking platform in your web browser at http://localhost:3000.
